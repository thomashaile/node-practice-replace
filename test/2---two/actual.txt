… In that Empir*, th* Art of Cartography attain*d such P*rf*ction that th* map of a
singl* Provinc* occupi*d th* *ntir*ty of a City, and th* map of th* Empir*, th* *ntir*ty
of a Provinc*. In tim*, thos* Unconscionabl* Maps no long*r satisfi*d, and th*
Cartograph*rs Guilds struck a Map of th* Empir* whos* siz* was that of th* Empir*, and
which coincid*d point for point with it. Th* following G*n*rations, who w*r* not so
fond of th* Study of Cartography as th*ir For*b*ars had b**n, saw that that vast Map
was Us*l*ss, and not without som* Pitil*ssn*ss was it, that th*y d*liv*r*d it up to th*
Incl*m*nci*s of Sun and Wint*rs. In th* D*s*rts of th* W*st, still today, th*r* ar*
Tatt*r*d Ruins of that Map, inhabit*d by Animals and B*ggars; in all th* Land th*r* is
no oth*r R*lic of th* Disciplin*s of G*ography.
