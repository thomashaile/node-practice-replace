        "The Library of Babel, by Jorge Luis Borges (1941)\n\n\n\nBy this art you may contemplate the variations of the 23 letters...\nThe Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV\n\n\n\nThe universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and\nperhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between,\nsurrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see,\ninterminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is\ninvariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except\ntwo; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that\nof a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which\nopens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and\nright of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep\nstanding up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here\npasses a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote\ndistances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all\nappearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it\nwere, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces\nrepresent and promise the infinite ... Light is provided by some spherical fruit\nwhich bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each\nhexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.\n\nLike all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in\nsearch of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can\nhardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the\nhexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious\nhands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body\n\n\n\nwill sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall,\nwhich is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the\nhexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our\nintuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is\ninconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular\nchamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which\nfollows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their\nwords, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the\nclassic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its\nhexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.\n\nThere are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains\nthirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages;\neach page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in\ncolor. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not\nindicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one\ntime seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in\nspite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall\na few axioms.\n\nFirst: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is\nthe future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable\nmind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent\ndemiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical\nvolumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated\nlibrarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the\ndivine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols\nwhich my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters\ninside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.\n\nSecond: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This finding\n\n\n\nmade it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the\nLibrary and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered:\nthe formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw\nin a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV,\nperversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted\nin this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time\nthy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of\nstraightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal\njumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians\nrepudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and\nequate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's\npalm ... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five\nnatural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the\nbooks signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely\nfallacious.)\n\nFor a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded\nto past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first\nlibrarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true\nthat a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther\nup, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten\npages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how\ndialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could\ninfluence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71\nwas not the one the same series may have in another position on another page,\nbut this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally,\nthis conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was\nformulated by its originators.\n\n\n\nFive hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book\nas confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous\n\n\n\nlines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were\nwritten in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the\nlanguage was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with\nclassical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of\ncombinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited\nrepetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover\nthe fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no\nmatter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space,\nthe period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a\nfact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical\nbooks. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is\ntotal and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd\northographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):\nEverything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels'\nautobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands\nof false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the\ndemonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of\nBasilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary\non that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all\nlanguages, the interpolations of every book in all books.\n\nWhen it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first\nimpression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the\nmasters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world\nproblem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe\nwas justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope.\nAt that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and\nprophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and\nretained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned\ntheir sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain\nintention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow\n\n\n\ncorridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways,\nflung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a\nsimilar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad ... The\nVindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to\npersons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that\nthe possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation\nthereof, can be computed as zero.\n\nAt that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic\nmysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar\nthat these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of\nphilosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the\nunprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four\ncenturies now men have exhausted the hexagons ... There are official searchers,\ninquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always\narrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which\nalmost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes\nthey pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.\nObviously, no one expects to discover anything.\n\nAs was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive\ndepression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books\nand that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A\nblasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men\nshould juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of\nchance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe\norders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for\nlong periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a\nforbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.\n\nOthers, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless\n\n\n\nworks. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always\nfalse, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves:\ntheir hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books.\nTheir name is execrated, but those who deplore the \"treasures\" destroyed by\nthis frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any\nreduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique,\nirreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred\nthousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma.\nCounter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the\nPurifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics\nproduced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the\nCrimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful,\nillustrated and magical.\n\nWe also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the\nBook. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book\nwhich is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has\ngone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone\nvestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of\nHim. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How\ncould one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him?\nSomeone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B\nwhich indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to\ninfinity ... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years.\nIt does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the\nuniverse 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were\nthousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom\nand happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though\nmy place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in\none being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that\nnonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and\n\n\n\npure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the\n\"feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing\ninto others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity.\"\nThese words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well,\nnotoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In\ntruth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the\ntwenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute\nnonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons\nunder my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The\nPlaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance\nincoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner;\nsuch a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I\ncannot combine some characters\n\ndhcmrlchtdj\n\nwhich the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret\ntongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which\nis not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the\npowerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and\nuseless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of\none of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of\npossible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol\nlibrary allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal\ngalleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words\nwhich define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of\nunderstanding my language?)\n\nThe methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men.\nThe certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into\nphantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves\n\n\n\nbefore books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know\nhow to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations\nwhich inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I\nbelieve I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years.\nPerhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human\nspecies - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will\nendure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious\nvolumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.\n\nI have just written the word \"infinite\".' I have not interpolated this adjective out\nof rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite.\nThose who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and\nstairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd.\nThose who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books\ndoes have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem:\nThe Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any\ndirection, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in\nthe same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My\nsolitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4 .\n\nTranslated by J. E. I.\n\n\n\nThe original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been\nlimited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of the\nalphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's\nnote.)\n\n2\n\nBefore, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have\ndestroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for\nmany nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian.\n\n3\n\nI repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For\nexample: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate\nand demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.\n\n4\n\nLetizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a\nsingle volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type,\ncontaining an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri\nsaid that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of\nthis silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other\nanalogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.\n",

He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were\nwritten in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the\nlanguage was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with\nclassical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of\ncombinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited\nrepetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover\nthe fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the essays, no\nmatter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space,\nthe period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a\nfact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical\nessays. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is\ntotal and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd\northographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):\nEverything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels'\nautobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands\nof false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the\ndemonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of\nBasilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary\non that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every essay in all\nlanguages, the interpolations of every essay in all essays.\n\nWhen it was proclaimed that the Library contained all essays, the first\nimpression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the\nmasters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world\nproblem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe\nwas justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope.\nAt that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: essays of apology and\nprophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and\nretained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned\ntheir sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain\nintention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow\n\n\n\ncorridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways,\nflung the deceptive essays into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a\nsimilar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad ... The\nVindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to\npersons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that\nthe possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation\nthereof, can be computed as zero.\n\nAt that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic\nmysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar\nthat these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of\nphilosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the\nunprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four\ncenturies now men have exhausted the hexagons ... There are official searchers,\ninquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always\narrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which\nalmost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes\nthey pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.\nObviously, no one expects to discover anything.\n\nAs was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive\ndepression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious essays\nand that these precious essays were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A\nblasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men\nshould juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of\nchance, these canonical essays. The authorities were obliged to issue severe\norders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for\nlong periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a\nforbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.\n\nOthers, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless\n\n\n\nworks. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always\nfalse, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves:\ntheir hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of essays.\nTheir name is execrated, but those who deplore the \"treasures\" destroyed by\nthis frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any\nreduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique,\nirreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred\nthousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma.\nCounter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the\nPurifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics\nproduced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the essays in the\nCrimson Hexagon: essays whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful,\nillustrated and magical.\n\nWe also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the\nBook. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a essay\nwhich is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has\ngone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone\nvestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of\nHim. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How\ncould one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him?\nSomeone proposed a regressive method: To locate essay A, consult first essay B\nwhich indicates A's position; to locate essay B, consult first a essay C, and so on to\ninfinity ... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years.\nIt does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total essay on some shelf of the\nuniverse 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were\nthousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom\nand happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though\nmy place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in\none being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that\nnonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and\n\n\n\npure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the\n\"feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing\ninto others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity.\"\nThese words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well,\nnotoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In\ntruth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the\ntwenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute\nnonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons\nunder my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The\nPlaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance\nincoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner;\nsuch a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I\ncannot combine some characters\n\ndhcmrlchtdj\n\nwhich the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret\ntongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which\nis not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the\npowerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and\nuseless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of\none of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of\npossible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol\nlibrary allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal\ngalleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words\nwhich define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of\nunderstanding my language?)\n\nThe methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men.\nThe certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into\nphantoms.

      "actual": "The Library of Babel, by Jorge Luis Borges (1941)\n\n\n\nBy this art you may contemplate the variations of the 23 letters...\nThe Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV\n\n\n\nThe universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and\nperhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between,\nsurrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see,\ninterminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is\ninvariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except\ntwo; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that\nof a normal essaycase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which\nopens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and\nright of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep\nstanding up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here\npasses a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote\ndistances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all\nappearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it\nwere, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces\nrepresent and promise the infinite ... Light is provided by some spherical fruit\nwhich bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each\nhexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.\n\nLike all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in\nsearch of a essay, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can\nhardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the\nhexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious\nhands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body\n\n\n\nwill sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall,\nwhich is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the\nhexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our\nintuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is\ninconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular\nchamber containing a great circular essay, whose spine is continuous and which\nfollows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their\nwords, obscure. This cyclical essay is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the\nclassic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its\nhexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.\n\nThere are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains\nthirty-five essays of uniform format; each essay is of four hundred and ten pages;\neach page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in\ncolor. There are also letters on the spine of each essay; these letters do not\nindicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one\ntime seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in\nspite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall\na few axioms.\n\nFirst: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, whose immediate corollary is\nthe future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable\nmind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent\ndemiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical\nvolumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated\nlibrarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the\ndivine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols\nwhich my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a essay, with the organic letters\ninside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.\n\nSecond: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This finding\n\n\n\nmade it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the\nLibrary and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered:\nthe formless and chaotic nature of almost all the essays. One which my father saw\nin a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV,\nperversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted\nin this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time\nthy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of\nstraightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal\njumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians\nrepudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in essays and\nequate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's\npalm ... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five\nnatural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the\nessays signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely\nfallacious.)\n\nFor a long time it was believed that these impenetrable essays corresponded\nto past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first\nlibrarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true\nthat a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther\nup, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten\npages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how\ndialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could\ninfluence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71\nwas not the one the same series may have in another position on another page,\nbut this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally,\nthis conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was\nformulated by its originators.\n\n\n\nFive hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a essay\nas confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous\n\n\n\nlines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were\nwritten in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the\nlanguage was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with\nclassical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of\ncombinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited\nrepetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover\nthe fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the essays, no\nmatter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space,\nthe period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a\nfact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical\nessays. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is\ntotal and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd\northographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):\nEverything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels'\nautobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands\nof false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the\ndemonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of\nBasilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary\non that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every essay in all\nlanguages, the interpolations of every essay in all essays.\n\nWhen it was proclaimed that the Library contained all essays, the first\nimpression was one of extravagant happiness.

To perceive the distance between the\ndivine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols\nwhich my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters\ninside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.\n\nSecond: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.^ This finding\n\n\n\nmade it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the\nLibrary and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered:\nthe formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw\nin a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV,\nperversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted\nin this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time\nthy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of\nstraightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal\njumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians\nrepudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and\nequate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's\npalm ... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five\nnatural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the\nbooks signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely\nfallacious.)\n\nFor a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded\nto past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first\nlibrarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true\nthat a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther\nup, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten\npages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how\ndialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could\ninfluence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71\nwas not the one the same series may have in another position on another page,\nbut this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally,\nthis conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was\nformulated by its originators.\n\n\n\nFive hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book\nas confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous\n\n\n\nlines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were\nwritten in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the\nlanguage was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with\nclassical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of\ncombinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited\nrepetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover\nthe fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no\nmatter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space,\nthe period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a\nfact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical\nbooks. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is\ntotal and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd\northographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):\nEverything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels'\nautobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands\nof false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the\ndemonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of\nBasilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary\non that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all\nlanguages, the interpolations of every book in all books.\n\nWhen it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first\nimpression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the\nmasters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world\nproblem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe\nwas justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope.\nAt that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and\nprophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and\nretained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned\ntheir sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain\nintention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow\n\n\n\ncorridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways,\nflung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a\nsimilar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad ... The\nVindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to\npersons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that\nthe possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation\nthereof, can be computed as zero.\n\nAt that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic\nmysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar\nthat these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of\nphilosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the\nunprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four\ncenturies now men have exhausted the hexagons ... There are official searchers,\ninquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always\narrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which\nalmost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes\nthey pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.\nObviously, no one expects to discover anything.\n\nAs was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive\ndepression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books\nand that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A\nblasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men\nshould juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of\nchance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe\norders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for\nlong periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a\nforbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.\n\nOthers, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless\n\n\n\nworks. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always\nfalse, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves:\ntheir hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books.\nTheir name is execrated, but those who deplore the \"treasures\" destroyed by\nthis frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any\nreduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique,\nirreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred\nthousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma.\nCounter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the\nPurifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics\nproduced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the\nCrimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful,\nillustrated and magical.\n\nWe also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the\nBook. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book\nwhich is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has\ngone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone\nvestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of\nHim. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How\ncould one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him?\nSomeone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B\nwhich indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to\ninfinity ... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years.\nIt does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the\nuniverse 3 ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were\nthousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom\nand happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though\nmy place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in\none being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that\nnonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and\n\n\n\npure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the\n\"feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing\ninto others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity.\"\nThese words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well,\nnotoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In\ntruth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the\ntwenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute\nnonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons\nunder my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The\nPlaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance\nincoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner;\nsuch a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I\ncannot combine some characters\n\ndhcmrlchtdj\n\nwhich the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret\ntongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which\nis not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the\npowerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and\nuseless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of\none of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of\npossible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol\nlibrary allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal\ngalleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words\nwhich define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of\nunderstanding my language?)\n\nThe methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men.\nThe certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into\nphantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves\n\n\n\nbefore books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know\nhow to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations\nwhich inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I\nbelieve I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years.\nPerhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human\nspecies - the unique species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will\nendure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious\nvolumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.\n\nI have just written the word \"infinite\".' I have not interpolated this adjective out\nof rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite.\nThose who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and\nstairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd.\nThose who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books\ndoes have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem:\nThe Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any\ndirection, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in\nthe same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My\nsolitude is gladdened by this elegant hope 4 .\n\nTranslated by J. E. I.\n\n\n\nThe original manuscript does not contain digits or capital letters. The punctuation has been\nlimited to the comma and the period. These two signs, the space and the twenty-two letters of the\nalphabet are the twenty-five symbols considered sufficient by this unknown author. (Editor's\nnote.)\n\n2\n\nBefore, there was a man for every three hexagons. Suicide and pulmonary diseases have\ndestroyed that proportion. A memory of unspeakable melancholy: at times I have traveled for\nmany nights through corridors and along polished stairways without finding a single librarian.\n\n3\n\nI repeat: it suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible is excluded. For\nexample: no book can be a ladder, although no doubt there are books which discuss and negate\nand demonstrate this possibility and others whose structure corresponds to that of a ladder.\n\n4\n\nLetizia Alvarez de Toledo has observed that this vast Library is useless: rigorously speaking, a\nsingle volume would be sufficient, a volume of ordinary format, printed in nine or ten point type,\ncontaining an infinite number if infinitely thin leaves. (In the early seventeenth century, Cavalieri\nsaid that all solid bodies are the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.) The handling of\nthis silky vade mecum would not be convenient: each apparent page would unfold into other\nanalogous ones; the inconceivable middle page would have no reverse.\n",

        "The Book of Sand\n\nby\n\nJorge Luis Borges\n\nThy rope of sands . . .\n— George Herbert\n\nThe line is made up of an infinite number of points; the plane of an infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite number of planes; the hypervolume of an infinite number of volumes. . . . No, unquestionably this is not—more geometrico—the best way of beginning my story. To claim that is it true is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine, however, is true.\n\nI live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street, in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features—or perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way. Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I found out that he came from the Orkneys.\n\nI invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him—as it does now from me.\n\n\"I sell Bibles,\" he said.\n\nSomewhat pedantically, I replied, \"In this house are several English Bibles, including the first—John Wiclif's. I also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's—which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst—and a Latin copy of the Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles I stand in need of.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, he said, \"I don't only sell Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you.\"\n\nHe opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through many hands. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words \"Holy Writ\" and, below them, \"Bombay.\"\n\n\"Nineteenth century, probably,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I've never found out.\"\n\nI opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries—an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.\n\nIt was at this point that the stranger said, \"Look at the illustration closely. You'll never see it again.\"\n\nI noted my place and closed the book. At once, I reopened it. Page by page, in vain, I looked for the illustration of the anchor. \"It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?\" I said to hide my dismay.\n\n\"No,\" he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. \"I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called the Book of Sand, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.\"\n\nThe stranger asked me to find the first page.\n\nI laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.\n\n\"Now find the last page.\"\n\nAgain I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely managed to stammer, \"This can't be.\"\n\nStill speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, \"It can't be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is no more or less than infinite. None is the first page, none the last. I don't know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any number.\"\n\nThen, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, \"If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time.\"\n\nHis speculations irritated me. \"You are religious, no doubt?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book.\"\n\nI assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I asked if he were just passing through this part of the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days. It was then that I learned that he was a Scot from the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a great personal affection for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume.\n\n\"You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns,\" he corrected.\n\nWhile we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned indifference, I asked, \"Do you intend to offer this curiosity to the British Museum?\"\n\n\"No. I'm offering it to you,\" he said, and he stipulated a rather high sum for the book.\n\nI answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of my reach, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came up with a scheme.\n\n\"I propose a swap, \" I said. \"You got this book for a handful of rupees and a copy of the Bible. I'll offer you the amount of my pension check, which I've just collected, and my black-letter Wiclif Bible. I inherited it from my ancestors.\"\n\n\"A black-letter Wiclif!\" he murmured.\n\nI went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He turned the leaves and studied the title page with all the fervor of a true bibliophile.\n\n\"It's a deal,\" he said.\n\nIt amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up to sell the book. Without counting the money, he put it away.\n\nWe talked about India, about Orkney, and about the Norwegian jarls who once ruled it. It was night when the man left. I have not seen him again, nor do I know his name.\n\nI thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on the shelf by the Wiclif, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of The Thousand and One Nights. I went to bed and did not sleep. At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the impossible book and leafed through its pages. On one of them I saw engraved a mask. The upper corner of the page carried a number, which I no longer recall, elevated to the ninth power.\n\nI showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. These twin preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. A prisoner of the book, I almost never went out anymore. After studying its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort. The small illustrations, I verified, came two thousand pages apart. I set about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was not long in filling up. Never once was an illustration repeated. At night, in the meager intervals my insomnia granted, I dreamed of the book.\n\nSummer came and went, and I realized that the book was monstrous. What good did it do me to think that I, who looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my hands, was any less monstrous? I felt that the book was a nightmarish object, an obscene thing that affronted and tainted reality itself.\n\nI thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an infinite book might likewise prove infinite and suffocate the planet with smoke. Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest. Before retirement, I worked on Mexico Street, at the Argentine National Library, which contains nine hundred thousand volumes. I knew that to the right of the entrance a curved staircase leads down into the basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept. One day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the door, I lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement's musty shelves.\n",

Late one evening, a few months back, angus-c heard a knock at my door. angus-c opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features—or perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way. Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. angus-c saw at once that he was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did angus-c realize that angus-c had been misled by his thin blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, angus-c found out that he came from the Orkneys.\n\nangus-c invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him—as it does now from me.\n\n\"angus-c sell Bibles,\" he said.\n\nSomewhat pedantically, angus-c replied, \"In this house are several English Bibles, including the first—John Wiclif's. angus-c also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's—which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst—and a Latin copy of the Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles angus-c stand in need of.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, he said, \"angus-c don't only sell Bibles. angus-c can show you a holy book angus-c came across on the outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you.\"\n\nHe opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through many hands. Examining it, angus-c was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words \"Holy Writ\" and, below them, \"Bombay.\"\n\n\"Nineteenth century, probably,\" angus-c remarked.\n\n\"angus-c don't know,\" he said. \"I've never found out.\"\n\nangus-c opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. angus-c noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. angus-c turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries—an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.\n\nIt was at this point that the stranger said, \"Look at the illustration closely. You'll never see it again.\"\n\nangus-c noted my place and closed the book. At once, angus-c reopened it. Page by page, in vain, angus-c looked for the illustration of the anchor. \"It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?\" angus-c said to hide my dismay.\n\n\"No,\" he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. \"angus-c acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how to read. angus-c suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called the Book of Sand, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.\"\n\nThe stranger asked me to find the first page.\n\nangus-c laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, angus-c opened the book. It was useless. Every time angus-c tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.\n\n\"Now find the last page.\"\n\nAgain angus-c failed. In a voice that was not mine, angus-c barely managed to stammer, \"This can't be.\"\n\nStill speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, \"It can't be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is no more or less than infinite. None is the first page, none the last. angus-c don't know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any number.\"\n\nThen, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, \"If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time.\"\n\nHis speculations irritated me. \"You are religious, no doubt?\" angus-c asked him.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. angus-c am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when angus-c gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book.\"\n\nangus-c assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and angus-c asked if he were just passing through this part of the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days.
